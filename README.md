## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - The build tool for the web

### What I learned

Being used to fetching data with a custom _useFetch_ hook, it was innovative to be able to use the recommended _useQuery_.

```js
const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
    queryFn: () => fetchData(ipAddress),
    queryKey: ["country", ipAddress],
  });
```
It was really fun and actually rather easy to use the Leaflet js library
```html
    <MapContainer
      {...mapContainerProps}
      center={[51.0337, 4.4795]}
      className="map"
    >
      <TileLayer {...titleLayerProps} />
      <UpdateMapCenter latitude={latitude} longitude={longitude} />
      <Marker position={coordinates} icon={customIcon}>
        <Popup>
          A pretty CSS3 popup. <br /> Easily customizable.
        </Popup>
      </Marker>
    </MapContainer>
```

### Continued development

In the future I will be focusing on using the recommended useQuery hook for fetching data. Manually memoizing and caching data seems a thing of the past 

### Useful resources

- [Medium - useQuery](https://medium.com/@bhairabpatra.iitd/usequery-hook-in-react-b06ef604ea46) - This helped me to quickly start using the useQuery hook for the basic fetch I needed.
